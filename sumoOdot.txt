Okay, so December is here and this evening I took on the time to research a interesting world in robotics. This has to do with the Sumo Robotics competitions that are amazing to watch. People from all walks of life create these robots battling it out yearly and I want in. The Sumo Robot is a robot that is placed on a platform with another. If one of the robots are pushed off the platform, then the other wins. After doing some research on how to build and the requirements, I went right into planning my own bot called 'Sumo Odot'.

The planning of the bot design was the first thing I wanted to focus on, but there are some requirements to follow. A "mini" Sumo bot must be 10cm x 10cm and only weigh at max 500g. This had me to scale back some ideas and first get into the parts desired for the build. The goal now is to create a prototype, then create a smaller version that can handle the overall tasks. After watching some YT videos and doing some forum research, I came to find that the parts are determined by the type of bot you create. Knowing that I am going to keep a square form factor for the bot, I went right away with drawing a schematic.
